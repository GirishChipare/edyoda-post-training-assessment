ASSINMENT 4-EXAMPLE VOTING APP

[root@ip-172-31-22-24 ~]# git clone https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app
[root@ip-172-31-22-24 ~]# ls
example-voting-app  get_helm.sh  istio-1.5.2  istio-1.5.2-linux.tar.gz  kubernetes-training

db-deployment.yaml  db-service.yaml  redis-deployment.yaml  redis-service.yaml  result-deployment.yaml  result-service.yaml  vote-deployment.yaml  vote-service.yaml  worker-deployment.yaml

On kubectl apply -f .  the voting app pods-db, redis, result and vote- will be created.

deployment.apps/db created
service/db created
deployment.apps/redis created
service/redis created
deployment.apps/result created
service/result created
deployment.apps/vote created
service/vote created
deployment.apps/worker created

With kubectl get po we can get the active or running pods

[root@ip-172-31-22-24 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get po
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-49j4d        2/2     Running   0          15s
redis-868d64d78-6qs2s     2/2     Running   0          15s
result-5d57b59f4b-spzcw   2/2     Running   0          15s
vote-94849dc97-cbvn6      2/2     Running   0          15s
worker-dd46d7584-q8qjq    2/2     Running   0          15s


With kubectl get svc  we can observe that NodePort is assigned to voting and result pods or not. In My case Node port is assigned to result and vote app
[root@ip-172-31-22-24 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
db           ClusterIP   10.100.82.205    <none>        5432/TCP         9s
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          38s
redis        ClusterIP   10.99.196.225    <none>        6379/TCP         9s
result       NodePort    10.109.127.125   <none>        5001:31001/TCP   9s
vote         NodePort    10.103.216.89    <none>        5000:31000/TCP   9s


Then after opening two separate browsers with the public IP with respective ports for Voting and result app we can vote and observe the votes.
 
  
  
  After deleting voting pod, the new voting pod gets created because of RS and works as normal.
  after deleting worker pod, the new worker pod gets created because of RS and works as normal.  
  After deleting DB pod we will lose all the data in that db but new db pod will be created because of REPLICASET
  but now the result app will not work because it will be expecting the input from the db which has hot deleted and fpr that we have to delete the result app so that it restarts and connect tp new db pod.
  The voting pods,worker pod are stateless but the database pod is statefull, so thats why the data is lost from db pod after deletion.
  [root@ip-172-31-22-24 k8s-specifications]# kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-49j4d
pod "db-b54cd94f4-49j4d" deleted

  Result pod stopped after db deletion bcz it was expecting the input from the db pod (which was previously deleted)
 and to make the result app work we now have to delete the result app.
